## Instructor: [Markus MÃ¼hlberger][instructor url]


When developing a Node.js app, you will probably need one or more of these dependencies: a database server, a key-value store, a background worker or a search engine. Installing and running these on your local machine gets messy fast. Data from your app can also interfere with other apps you are developing on the same system.

With Vagrant you can isolate these dependencies in a virtual machine, start and stop them all together, and save yourself having to setup everything all over when your system crashes or when you move to a new computer. In this course, you will learn how to create a virtual machine with Vagrant, configure it for Node.js development and share it with others.


## Source Files Description

The source files contain the Node.js app we are going to use as an example application in this course. It uses MongoDB and Redis for data and session storage, as well as socket.io for real-time communication with the client. Of course, there is also a `Vagrantfile` for which defines Vagrant box!
